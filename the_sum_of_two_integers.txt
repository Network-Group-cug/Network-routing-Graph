Problem Description
I have a very simple problem for you. Given two integers A and B, your job is to calculate the Sum of A + B.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T(1<=T<=20) which means the number of test cases. Then T lines follow, each line consists of two positive integers, A and B. Notice that the integers are very large, that means you should not process them by using 32-bit integer. You may assume the length of each integer will not exceed 1000.
Output
For each test case, you should output two lines. The first line is "Case #:", # means the number of the test case. The second line is the an equation "A + B = Sum", Sum means the result of A + B. Note there are some spaces int the equation. Output a blank line between two test cases.
Sample Input
2
1 2
112233445566778899 998877665544332211
Sample Output
Case 1:
1 + 2 = 3

Case 2:
112233445566778899 + 998877665544332211 = 1111111111111111110

                        c[i]=a[n1]+b[n2]-'0'+p;
